                    <p>That’s a good question, I’m glad you asked! I believe that my experience with front end developing in the web design space make me the best match for this position. You should hire me for this position because of my proven ability to maintain strong interpersonal relationships with several clients with their needs. I am passionate about providing support to those in need in my community or any where in the world, which keeps me motivated and excited about doing my best work. In my previous job, I was responsible for building the front end portion of websites and web applications that is the part that users actually see and interact with. This required keeping employee profiles updated and continuously posting any data or information regarding upcoming events. I truly enjoyed what I was doing, which is what drew me to this position with your company. I would love to bring my highly proficient coding and content designing skills I learned there to this position.

                <h2>WHAT I DO FOR FUN.</h2>
                <p>Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source projects. I enjoy spending 5+ hours everyday on YouTube learning new skills and tips to better my skill set. That helps me learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. In my free time you can find me skateboarding or playing baseball at any baseball field in the Las Vegas, Nevada area. I also love going to the beach to relax and watch the ocean flow like vast rivers, sweeping along predictable paths. Too bad I don’t live near one but I do takes trips to Cali once in a while just to go swimming which is very worth it. Last but not least I enjoy heading to any tech meetups in my area to study other designers and developers. I usually try to attend every one of them whenever they are hosted near me. I honestly enjoy these tech meetups because every meetup that I attend, I’ll always come back home with some knowledge from people that’s higher than me in my field.

                    . I still remember the first time I created an HTML page and opened it in the browser. A whole new world of possibilities appeared before my eyes.
